;;; Commentary:

;; Package gets information about viewing progress of the media files.
;; It parses data, saved by media players - for now only mpv player supported.
;;
;; Preparations:
;; Install mpv player. You can save position on exit manually using
;; "Shift-Q" shortcut, or add these lines to the mpv config:
;;
;; keep-open=yes
;; save-position-on-quit=yes
;;
;; Optionally - install "mediainfo" app to display progress and "completed"
;; status.
;;
;; Usage:
;; Package provides function `media-progress-info-string' which will
;; return progress string for media file.
